[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jamiefdhurst/journal.svg)](https://github.com/jamiefdhurst/journal/releases)

A simple web-based journal written in Go. You can post, edit and view entries,
with the addition of an API.

It makes use of a SQLite database to store the journal entries.

[API Documentation](api/README.md)

## Purpose

Journal serves as an easy-to-read and simple Golang program for new developers 
to try their hand at modifying, extending and playing with. It deliberately has 
only one dependency to ensure that the full end-to-end flow of the system can 
be udnerstood through standard Golang libraries.

It's also a nice little Journal that you can use to keep your thoughts in, or 
as a basic blog platform.

## Installation and Setup (local method)

1. Clone the repository to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/jamiefdhurst/journal`.
2. Make sure the `$GOPATH/data` directory exists.
3. Change directory to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/jamiefdhurst/journal`.
4. Run `go get` to install dependencies
5. Run `go build journal` to create the executable.
6. Run `./journal` to load the application on port 3000. You should now be able
    to fully access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Installation and Setup (Docker method)

_Please note: you will need Docker installed on your local machine._

1. Clone the repository to your chosen folder.
2. Build the container with `docker build -t journal:latest .`
3. Run the following to load the application and serve it on port 3000. You
    should now be able to fully access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v ./data:/go/data -p 3000:3000 -it journal:latest
    ```

## Environment Variables

* `J_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE` - Articles to display per page, default `20`
* `J_CREATE` - Set to `0` to disable article creation
* `J_DB_PATH` - Path to SQLite DB - default is `$GOPATH/data/journal.db`
* `J_EDIT` - Set to `0` to disable article modification
* `J_GIPHY_API_KEY` - Set to a GIPHY API key to use, or ignore to disable GIPHY
* `J_PORT` - Port to expose over HTTP, default is `3000`
* `J_TITLE` - Set the title of the Journal

To use the API key within your Docker setup, include it as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -e J_GIPHY_API_KEY=... -v ./data:/go/data -p 3000:3000 -it journal:latest
```

## Layout

The project layout follows the standard set out in the following document:
[https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

* `/api` - API documentation
* `/internal/app/controller` - Controllers for the main application
* `/internal/app/model` - Models for the main application
* `/internal/app/router` - Implementation of router for given app
* `/pkg/adapter` - Adapters for connecting to external services
* `/pkg/controller` - Controller logic
* `/pkg/database` - Database connection logic
* `/pkg/router` - Router for handling services
* `/test` - API tests
* `/test/data` - Test data
* `/test/mocks` - Mock files for testing
* `/web/app` - CSS/JS source files
* `/web/static` - Compiled static public assets
* `/web/templates` - View templates

## Development

### Back-end

The back-end can be extended and modified following the folder structure above. 
Tests for each file live alongside and are designed to be easy to read and as 
functionally complete as possible.

The easiest way to develop incrementally is to use a local go installation and 
run your Journal as follows:

```bash
go run journal.go
```

Naturally, any changes to the logic or functionality will require a restart of 
the binary itself.

#### Dependencies

The application currently only has one dependency:

* [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

This can be installed using the following commands from the journal folder:

```bash
go get -d -v ./...
go install -v ./...
```

#### Templates

The templates are in `html/template` format in _web/templates_ and are used 
within each of the controllers. These can be modified while the binary stays 
loaded, as they are loaded on the fly by the application as it runs and serves 
content.

### Front-end

The front-end source files are in _web/app_ and require some tooling and 
dependencies to be installed via `npm` such as gulp and webpack. You can then 
use the following build targets:

* `gulp sass` - Compiles the SASS source into CSS
* `gulp webpack` - Uglifies and minifies the JS
* `gulp` - Watches for changes in SASS/JS files and immediately compiles

### Building/Testing

All pushed code is currently built using a private Jenkins instance that uses 
the included Jenkinsfile to run the tests using multiple docker containers that 
run versions of Go to check compatibility.

To test locally, simply use:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
